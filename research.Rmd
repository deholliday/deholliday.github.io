Recent research documents the "nationalization" of election results in the United States; national- and state-level vote shares for candidates of the same party are increasingly correlated and election winners tend to be copartisans. Does the nationalization of electoral results extend to campaign rhetoric itself? In this paper, I utilize quantitative text analysis techniques to determine the degree to which the rhetoric of gubernatorial candidates can or cannot be distinguished from the rhetoric of their national counterparts. The results show a more nuanced picture of nationalized rhetoric; in some forums, such as televised debates, gubernatorial speech is easily distinguishable from the speech of presidential candidates. In less structured formats, such as advertisements and social media, gubernatorial speech is still mostly relevant to state topics, but is slightly more likely to reference national topics. These results speak to the complex information environment voters may encounter in downballot contests.

#### A Streetlight Left Desired: Inequalities in City Service Delivery (Working Paper, with Brian T. Hamel)

Recent work raises concerns about whether all citizens have equal political voice. We assess inequalities in public goods and service provision in U.S. cities, the primary provider of these resources. We introduce the largest dataset of citizen-initiated demands for services — almost 25 million requests from 15 cities over a 10-year period. We link these data to information about neighborhood characteristics, and show that cities respond faster to advantaged neighborhoods than less advantaged neighborhoods. However, we show the substantive magnitude of these differences are small. For example, we find that service demands from white neighborhoods are responded to about 1.9 hours faster than the same demands from less white neighborhoods. These findings lead us to conclude that citizens of all economic and demographic backgrounds are much closer to “political equals” than not in access to public goods and services.

#### Income, Education and Policy Priorities (Working Paper, with Chris Tausanovitch)

Long-standing debates in political science center around differences in policy preferences across income and education subgroups and the subsequent quality with which those subgroups' preferences are represented by elected officials. In this paper, we evaluate a different way in which these groups could be poorly represented: preference *intensity*. We build on recent methods for measuring preference intensity to evaluate intensity with respect to 58 different policies and identity considerations. We find substantial differences in the preferences of people with lower incomes or education levels and people with higher incomes or education levels, but conditional on preferences there are few differences among education and income groups in terms of preference intensity. Conditional on policy positions, low income and low education voters care about the same issues that high income and high education voters care about.

#### <a href="deholliday.github.io/pdfs/Holliday_Conjoint_Nationalization.pdf" target="_blank">D.C. On My Mind: National Considerations in Local Political Decisions</a> (Working Paper, with Aaron Rudkin)

Recent research suggests national-level politics inform local-level behavior. To what extent is such behavior driven by lack of local political information or strength of partisan identity? Even if voters have local information, is it more important in decision-making than information that cues issues of partisan national importance? Utilizing conjoint experiments, we identify the strength voters place on national versus local issue positions in federal and state/local elections.
