Within states, partisan vote shares of presidential and gubernatorial candidates are becoming increasingly correlated, raising an important question for representation: are election results increasingly similar because voters genuinely prefer candidates of a particular type or because voters see state races as referenda on national politics? Recent research focuses on explanations derived from voters, elites, and media.  Largely ignored, however, is where these explanations intersect: campaigns and campaign rhetoric. Because national issues are efficient and proven motivators, state candidates may emphasize them to influence voters.  I evaluate this possibility using text analysis and machine learning techniques on a corpus of presidential and gubernatorial electoral debates from 2000 to 2018. I find little evidence of nationalized campaign appeals; candidates tend to emphasize issues germane to their jurisdiction. These findings suggest similarities in outcomes independent of direct candidate appeals, necessitating renewed focus on the voter decision-making process in state and local politics.

#### A Streetlight Left Desired: Inequalities in City Service Delivery (Working Paper, with Brian T. Hamel)

Recent work raises concerns about whether all citizens have equal political voice. We assess inequalities in public goods and service provision in U.S. cities, the primary provider of these resources. We introduce the largest dataset of citizen-initiated demands for services — almost 25 million requests from 15 cities over a 10-year period. We link these data to information about neighborhood characteristics, and show that cities respond faster to advantaged neighborhoods than less advantaged neighborhoods. However, we show the substantive magnitude of these differences are small. For example, we find that service demands from white neighborhoods are responded to about 1.9 hours faster than the same demands from less white neighborhoods. These findings lead us to conclude that citizens of all economic and demographic backgrounds are much closer to “political equals” than not in access to public goods and services.

#### Income, Education and Policy Priorities (Working Paper, with Chris Tausanovitch)

Long-standing debates in political science center around differences in policy preferences across income and education subgroups and the subsequent quality with which those subgroups' preferences are represented by elected officials. In this paper, we evaluate a different way in which these groups could be poorly represented: preference *intensity*. We build on recent methods for measuring preference intensity to evaluate intensity with respect to 58 different policies and identity considerations. We find substantial differences in the preferences of people with lower incomes or education levels and people with higher incomes or education levels, but conditional on preferences there are few differences among education and income groups in terms of preference intensity. Conditional on policy positions, low income and low education voters care about the same issues that high income and high education voters care about.

#### Donald On My Mind: National Considerations in Local Political Decisions (Working Paper)

Recent research suggests national-level politics inform local-level behavior. To what extent is such behavior driven by lack of local political information or strength of partisan identity? Even if voters have local information, is it more important in decision-making than information that cues issues of partisan national importance? Utilizing conjoint experiments, I identify the strength voters place on national versus local issue positions in federal and state/local elections.
