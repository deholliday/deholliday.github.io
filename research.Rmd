Recent research contends state and local elections are driven by presidential contests, presenting correlations between presidential and down-ballot voting as evidence. This work assumes a top-down relationship, often called "nationalization." I propose an alternative theoretical framework in which I decompose election results into candidate specific, partisan, and idiosyncratic components. I apply this framework to presidential, senate, and governor elections from 1972-2020, 476 statewide elections across 26 offices from 2016-2020, and all partisan down-ballot races in Maricopa County, Arizona from 2008-2020. While it is true that election results are tied together increasingly by partisanship, I find it is not true that presidential elections are the most strongly tied to partisanship. My findings are consequential for how we understand partisan voting behavior and how we evaluate quality political representation in state and local contexts.
