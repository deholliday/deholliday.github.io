### Job Market Paper: The Reaches and Limits of Nationalization in U.S. Politics

Recent research contends American political behavior has nationalized; election results in state and local contests are increasingly driven by presidential contests and their associated issues. Significant correlations between presidential results and down-ballot races are often presented as evidence of such nationalization. This work assumes a top-down relationship between presidential and down-ballot results, with evidence limited by the subset of offices analyzed. I propose an alternative theoretical framework. Electoral contests can differ either because (1) candidates for a given party perform better or worse in different races, or (2) because candidate performance has a different relationship to voter preferences. This framework does not assume a causal relationship but can be used to test implications of the nationalization hypothesis. I operationalize this with a measurement model that covers presidential, senatorial, and gubernatorial elections from 1972-2020, 476 statewide elections across 26 offices from 2016-2020, and all partisan downballot races in a large U.S. county from 2008-2020. I show that elections have homogenized over time, but variation remains, particularly for high salience races, regardless of whether they comprise national or state offices. Additionally, incumbency moderates the magnitude of this homogeneity across all office types, while news and information levels have non-significant relationships. These results paint a more nuanced picture of nationalization not as a phenomena where all elections are simply referenda on the presidency, but as a homogenization of candidate, office, and issue features over similar dimensions, with consequences for how we evaluate the quality of political representation in state and local contexts.
