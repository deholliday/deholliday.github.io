Recent research contends state and local elections are driven by presidential contests, presenting correlations between presidential and down-ballot voting as evidence. However, this top-down mechanism of "nationalized" election results, which I call "presidentialization", is indistinguishable from other mechanisms, such as increasing partisan strength, using such measurement strategies. I propose an alternative theoretical framework in which I decompose election results into candidate specific, partisan, and idiosyncratic components, allowing me to compare mechanisms of nationalization. I apply this framework to presidential, senate, governor, and other statewide elections from 1972-2020, 476 statewide elections across 26 offices from 2016-2020, and all partisan down-ballot races in Maricopa County, Arizona from 2008-2020. While it is true that election results are increasingly similar, they appear connected more by partisanship than presidential voting. Presidential contests are among the most idiosyncratic; lower-salience elections have little variance. While it is reassuring elections for lower office do not appear determined by presidential candidates, the lack of alternative information to partisanship paints a troubling representational picture down-ballot.
