I am a PhD student in Political Science at UCLA. My research interests are broadly related to representation, especially at local levels of government in the United States. Specifically, my research aims to determine the degree to which national-level politics influence local-level decisions and quantify the consequences of such nationalization. I utilize methods involving big data, machine learning, and text-as-data.
