I am a PhD candidate in Political Science at UCLA, where I am jointly pursuing a Master's degree in Statistics. My research interests are broadly related to representation, especially at state/local levels of government in the United States. Specifically, my current research aims to determine the degree to which national-level politics influence state/local-level decisions and quantify the consequences of such nationalization. I utilize methods involving big data, machine learning, text-as-data, and survey experiments.

Currently, I work as a research analyst for the UCLA COVID-19 Health and Politics Project, a collaboration between social scientists and doctors measuring people's pandemic experiences and attitudes. Our work has been featured in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/04/upshot/vaccine-incentive-experiment.html" target="_blank">New York Times</a> and published in *Vaccine*. Previously, I was the project coordinator on <a href="https://www.voterstudygroup.org/nationscape" target="_blank">Nationscape</a>, a U.S. election survey that interviewed almost half a million respondents through the 2020 Presidential campaign. Nationscape was funded by the Democracy Fund. 

Outside academia, you can find me trail/mountain/long distance running (from nothing in particular) and thanklessly rooting for the Seattle Mariners.
