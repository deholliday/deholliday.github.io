Hello! I am a Postdoctoral Fellow for the <a href="https://polarizationresearchlab.org/" target="_blank">Polarization Research Lab</a> at Stanford University. I received my PhD in Political Science at UCLA. My research interests lie at the intersection of political behavior and institutions, with a focus on representation. I am specifically interested in how partisan identification and animosity structures behavior across all levels of U.S. politics: national, state, and local. My current research aims to determine the degree to which national-level politics influence state/local-level decisions and quantify the consequences of such nationalization. I utilize methods involving big data, machine learning, text-as-data, and survey experiments. My work is published in the *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences* and the *Quarterly Journal of Political Science*, and has been cited in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/24/us/politics/trump-prosecutions-threats-violence.html" target="_blank">New York Times</a>.

Most recently, I worked as a research analyst for the UCLA COVID-19 Health and Politics Project, a collaboration between social scientists and doctors measuring people's pandemic experiences and attitudes. Our work was featured in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/04/upshot/vaccine-incentive-experiment.html" target="_blank">New York Times</a> and published in *Vaccine*. Previously, I was the project coordinator on <a href="https://www.voterstudygroup.org/nationscape" target="_blank">Nationscape</a>, a U.S. election survey that interviewed almost half a million respondents through the 2020 Presidential campaign. Nationscape was funded by the Democracy Fund. 

Outside academia, you can find me trail/mountain/long distance running (from nothing in particular) and ~~thanklessly~~ rooting for the Seattle Mariners.
