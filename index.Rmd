I am a PhD student in Political Science at UCLA. My research interests are broadly related to representation, especially at local levels of government in the United States. Specifically, my research aims to determine the degree to which national-level politics influence local-level decisions and quantify the consequences of such nationalization. I utilize methods involving big data, machine learning, and text-as-data. 

Currently, I work as the project coordinator on <a href="https://www.voterstudygroup.org/nationscape" target="_blank">Nationscape</a>, a U.S. election survey that has interviewed over half a million respondents through the 2020 Presidential campaign. Nationscape is funded by the Democracy Fund. Additionally, I am a research analyst for the UCLA COVID-19 Health and Politics Project, a collaboration between social scientists and doctors measuring people's pandemic experiences and attitudes. Our work has been featured in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/04/upshot/vaccine-incentive-experiment.html" target="_blank">New York Times</a>.

Outside academia, you can find me trail/mountain/long distance running (from nothing in particular) and thanklessly rooting for the Seattle Mariners.
